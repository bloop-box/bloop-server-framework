//! Player management module.
//!
//! This module provides traits and structures for managing player information,
//! including read-only access ([`PlayerInfo`]), mutation capabilities
//! ([`PlayerMutator`]), and a concurrent registry ([`PlayerRegistry`]) to store
//! and lookup players by both UUID and NFC UID.
//!
//! The `PlayerRegistry` maintains internal consistency by updating NFC UID
//! mappings automatically when players' NFC UIDs change, enabling safe
//! concurrent access via `Arc<RwLock<Player>>` wrappers.
//!
//! It supports operations to add, remove, mutate, and query players efficiently.

# Bloop Server Framework

This library helps you to quickly get a Bloop server up and running. It handles all the heavy lifting like the network
protocol, general game logic, and a few additional extras.

The framework implements the Bloop Protocol v3 and is not ready for general usage yet!

## Quick start

A minimal in-memory example can be found in the `examples` folder. You can run it like this:

```shell
cargo run --example simple --all-features
```

## Evaluators

This library comes with a couple of generic evaluators you can plug straight into your achievements!
